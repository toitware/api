# Toit API

This repository contains the API definitions for [Toit](https://toit.io/). The API is defined using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and it can 
be used from any environment and from any programming language.

You are in full control of your devices and the data your devices emits. Everything you can do with the Toit platform, i.e. both from the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) and via the [Toit CLI](https://docs.toit.io/getstarted/installation), you can do through the public Toit API. 

It is easy to integrate our platform into your IoT products and provide full serviceability for your device fleet.

Browse through the [relevant documentation](https://docs.toit.io/apis/api/) for more details, and see examples of usage in the [demo repository](https://github.com/toitware/demos/tree/master/api).
